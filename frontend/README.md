# Frontend app

## Set up

-   `.env`: set your **public** Stripe API in **PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY**
-   `.env.development`: set the URL/port of your local backend server in **PUBLIC_API_URL** (likely http://localhost:8080)
-   `.env.production`: set the URL of your deployed production backend server

    -   The reason for doing this is so that you can easily change backend production environments withou needing to remember where it's referenced in the code.

-   Don't forget to set the environment variables in your production environment (such as Netlify)
